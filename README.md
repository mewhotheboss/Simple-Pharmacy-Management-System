# Pharmacy Management System (Java Swing)

This project demonstrates the use of **Java Swing** with **NetBeans** to create a **Pharmacy Management System**. The system allows an **admin/owner** to manage inventory and staff, while connecting to a **MySQL database** for storing records of medicines and transactions. The design is created using **NetBeans' drag-and-drop** interface, with auto-generated code.
